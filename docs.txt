## Python Toolkit ##

This is a set of tools designed to automate commons tasks.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can check by running: 
    python --version


## Steps to Set Up a Virtual Environment

1. ** Open your terminal **.

2. ** Navigate to your project directory **

3. ** Create a virtual environment ** by running: 

    python -m venv venv

4. ** Activate the virtual environment **:

- On ** Windows* *:
  ```
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On ** macOS and Linux **:
  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

5. ** Install necessary packages ** using `pip`. For example:

    pip install package_name

6. ** Deactivate the virtual environment ** when you are done:

    deactivate

## Notes
- To reactivate the virtual environment later, repeat step 4.
- You can list the installed packages and their versions by running:

    pip freeze > requirements.txt


This will create a `requirements.txt` file that can be used to replicate the environment later.
